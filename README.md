I added two new files in src/bcr_bot/launch/warehouse_with_tiago.launch.py and src/tiago_robot/tiago_description/launch/tiago_spawn.launch.py. \
Also I downloaded the smallwarehouse model seperately. You may need to have that.\

The command to run the simulation is ros2 launch bcr_bot warehouse_with_tiago.launch.py
